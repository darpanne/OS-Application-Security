# OS and Application Security Techniques

## Objective
To explore and implement security mechanisms for operating systems and applications, focusing on user access management, file permissions, security assessments, and network traffic analysis.

## Skills Learned
- Managing domain users and access permissions.
- Implementing security policies using Group Policy and NTFS file permissions.
- Performing security analysis using MBSA and BPA.
- Configuring and managing virtual environments with Vsphere Client.
- Securing Linux and Windows file systems.
- Using TCP Dump for network traffic analysis.

## Tools Used
- Windows Server (Group Policy, NTFS)
- MBSA (Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer)
- BPA (Best Practices Analyzer)
- Vsphere Client, PuTTY
- Linux Command-Line Tools (Mounting, TCP Dump)
- Icacls (Windows File Permissions Management)
